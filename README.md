# ERRATIC C2 
Python based C2 server based on socketio and http/s

HOW TO INSTALL
Ensure you have python3.8+, make an issue if you have any problems with this software.

Get and enter the repo:
`git clone 0https://github.com/elapt1c/erratic.git`
`cd erratic`

Install all required python packages (on the server side)
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Configure the config.yml file to your liking.
Then simply run the server application:
`python3 main.py`

And it should be good to go! based on your config.yml, it will edit the payload response.
`http://x.x.x.x:xxxx/payload` will give you a python file for the clients. as long as this is running and it is set up correctly, the client will contact the server and give you control.
if you go to `http://x.x.x.x:xxxx/` you will be able to access the WebUi and login with the credentials you set in config.yml.
